## Reflection

Working on this project with Git and GitHub provided valuable experience in managing a portfolio project using version control. The branching feature in Git allowed me to work on different parts of the website separately without interfering with the main codebase. 

A minor conflict occurred while merging the portfolio section branch into the main branch, as I had made some changes to the CSS file in both branches. However, using Git’s conflict resolution tools, I was able to merge the branches successfully after reviewing and testing the changes.
